Recently I rebuilt my portfolio with React and static site generator GatsbyJS.
I initially built a server side rendered Vue application which pulled in blog posts from a headless CMS called Tipe but I decided that was kind of insane for what I was doing. I picked up Gatsby - which is just like writing a server-side rendered React app but you render it at build time and deploy statically.
