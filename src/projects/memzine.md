Memzine is a project I'm developing in my spare time. It's a full ground up NodeJS/MongoDB build currently with VueJS (although I will be rewriting with React).

_Apparently I love purple gradients at the moment._

The concept is a journal that encourages users to write short snippets every day and compete with other users to reach the highest streak. Journal entries are encrypted so not visible on the server.
