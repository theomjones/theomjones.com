Built with [HyperApp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) (a 1KB cross between Elm and React) with a focus on performance, TTFB & useability. Uses Service Workers to allow full app functionality offline in Chrome for Android and newer versions of Safari on iOS.

As a progressive web app it offers a close to native app experience on Android (utilising Google's support for PWAs). E.g. Web Manifests, Splash Screens, App Caching, Local Storage.

This was more of a concept project in optimising performance and working with Service Workers - it is not an example of how an application should be built.
