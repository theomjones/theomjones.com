![App Mockup](https://theomjonesimg.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/gosmlr-ios.jpg)

I needed a small, simple concept that would let me develop a back-end, data-persistance layer, front-end and native iOS app and tie them all together - I just wanted to see what the process was like and to give me some practice in React Native which I hadn't touched prior.

I chose a URL shortener as its quick to make, the database just needs one simple table and the applications themselves would be a breeze.

I can't remember exactly how long the whole process took but it was under a week (in my spare time) for everything. That's without a solid test suite mind.
